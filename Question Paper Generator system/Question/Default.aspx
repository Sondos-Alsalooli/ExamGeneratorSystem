Exams are considered as a major and necessary part of any educational process, which aims to measure the potential of students. The process of preparing question papers requires effort and time and has to satisfy some previously determined requirements like difficulty level of the questions, learning outcomes covered etc., therefore we have came up with a project called (KKU Exams Generation System).The proposed System is an Question paper generator that allows teachers to create professional quality question papers within no time, while keeping constraints like LO’s covered etc under consideration. Questions are organized by topics, & learning outcomes in the bank, so creating quality question paper with the proposed system is fast and easy. The objective of our project is to generate or produce exam question papers that are competent and have high quality. Our system is based upon genetic algorithm, which generates accurate exam question papers. Additionally, our system also improves the security of question papers from being leaked, by allowing generating question papers just few moments before exam.
